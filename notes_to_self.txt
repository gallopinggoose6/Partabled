While it is pretty handy to be able to read file systems, do we know how best to 
handle the modification of the data within them? 

For example, FAT does everything based off of disk offsets, so what might be our
strategy for ensuring that all offsets get properly updated, with the least 
amount of RAM usage as possible (as the rest will be for storing our chunks of 
data we are moving about). 

Would best option be to add a function to the Filesystem trait along the lines 
of "update_to_new_location" or something, and leave the implementation of that 
to each driver?
